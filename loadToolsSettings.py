# This is setting file for loadToolsAuto generator. 
#
# If you want to add new macro and create command Class for it, 
# add here the new entry and run: 
# 
# python3 ./loadToolsAuto.py
#
# There is no need to add it to workbench startup.
#
# Macro row order:
#
# 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
#
# 0 - sub-directory name
# 1 - macro filename, this will be also registered command name
# 2 - icon filename extension (only extension, filename will be get from macro filename)
# 3 - MenuText - command name visible for user after icon mouse hover
# 4 - ToolTip - description visible for user after icon mouse hover
#
# example: 
#
# "", "getDimensions", "png", "getDimensions, BOM, cutlist", "Creates spreadsheet with dimensions to cut.", # no comma if last
